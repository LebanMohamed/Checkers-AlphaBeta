The src folder contains all the the code used for the checkers game.
The dist folder contains the executable jar file for the checkers game, named 'Checkers.jar'.

Make sure the Checkers.jar file is in the same directory as lib and CheckerDatabase.db. 
Otherwise the images used for the checkers game will not load and the database will not connect.

The menu items takes some time to load when the window first opens. Double click it if it doesn't load.

This has been rigorously tested on a mac.
